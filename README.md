# HomieAI
HomieAI is built to make the process of finding budget-friendly shared housing easier and more organized. Right now, most people rely on scattered WhatsApp groups and Facebook Marketplace, which can be messy and time-consuming. This project aims to bring everything into one place for a smoother and more efficient experience.
